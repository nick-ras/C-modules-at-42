# C++ Modules Project

## Description
The **C++ Modules** project is designed to provide foundational knowledge of the C++ language, its core concepts, and how to use it in various programming scenarios. The project includes a series of modules that each cover key C++ concepts, focusing on developing practical skills that can be applied in real-world projects.

---

## Modules Overview

### Module 00 - **C++ Basics**
The first module focuses on the basic syntax and structure of C++ programming. It includes topics such as:
- Variable declaration and initialization
- Control structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions and function overloading
- Arrays and basic data types

This module is intended for beginners to get familiar with the basic components of the C++ language.

---

### Module 01 - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics**
This module introduces the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming in C++. Topics covered include:
- Classes and objects
- Member variables and functions
- Constructors and destructors
- Access control (private, public, protected)

The goal of this module is to give a solid understanding of how to structure C++ programs using OOP concepts.

---

### Module 02 - **Advanced OOP & Inheritance**
Building upon Module 01, this module delves deeper into the more advanced aspects of OOP. It focuses on:
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Function overriding and virtual functions
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
- Operator overloading

Module 02 aims to strengthen understanding of object-oriented principles, allowing students to design more complex systems using inheritance and polymorphism.

---

## Project Requirements
Each module contains exercises to apply what youâ€™ve learned, with the following general requirements:
- **Code Style:** Maintain clean, readable, and properly commented code.
- **Error Handling:** Use appropriate error handling techniques.
- **Memory Management:** Demonstrate proper memory management in C++ (e.g., using pointers and destructors).

---

## Key Restrictions & Challenges

- **Memory Management:**  
  In C++, you need to manually manage memory (using `new` and `delete`), which can be challenging but is important for building efficient applications.

- **Object-Oriented Principles:**  
  Mastering OOP concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation can be difficult, but is essential for designing scalable and maintainable C++ applications.

- **C++ Syntax and Semantics:**  
  The syntax and rules of C++ can be tricky, especially with pointers, memory allocation, and operator overloading.

---

## Running It

### 1. **Compile the Code**
To compile the C++ code, use the following `g++` command:

```bash
g++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror module_00.cpp -o module_00
